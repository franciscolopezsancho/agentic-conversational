To understand the Akka concepts that are the basis for this example, see [Development Process](https://doc.akka.io/concepts/development-process.html) in the documentation.


This project contains the skeleton to create an Akka service. To understand more about these components, see [Developing services](https://doc.akka.io/java/index.html). Examples can be found [here](https://doc.akka.io/java/samples.html).


Use Maven to build your project:

```shell
mvn compile
```


When running an Akka service locally.

To start your service locally, run:

```shell
mvn compile exec:java
```

This command will start your Akka service. With your Akka service running, the endpoint it's available at:

```shell
curl http://localhost:9000/hello
```


You can use the [Akka Console](https://console.akka.io) to create a project and see the status of your service.

Build container image:

```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Install the `akka` CLI as documented in [Install Akka CLI](https://doc.akka.io/reference/cli/index.html).

Deploy the service using the image tag from above `mvn install`:

```shell
akka service deploy agentic-conversational agentic-conversational:tag-name --push
```

Refer to [Deploy and manage services](https://doc.akka.io/operations/services/deploy-service.html)
for more information.
